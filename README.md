We have done Exploratory Data analysis for different features.
We prepared our Data and build different ML Models.
We have seen how different models are performing w.r.t Accuracy,Precision,Recall and F1 Scores.
Random Forest with default parameters is giving 100% accuracy on training and test dataset.
We have tried using Boosting technique XGBoost and we have a model with 96% accuracy with improvement in False Poitive and False Negative.
We have further tried doing hyper parameter tuning for XGBoost.We can with different parameters and see if further we can reduce the FP and FN.
